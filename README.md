# Milestone Project 2 – Vegan Recipe Finder

## Overview
**Vegan Recipe Finder** is an interactive front‑end web application that helps users discover vegan recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. It integrates with the Spoonacular API to:

- Add multiple ingredients as removable tags  
- Apply optional filters (Gluten‑Free, High‑Protein, Quick Meals)  
- Display results in a modern, responsive card grid with shortened summaries  
- Save favorites via a ★/☆ toggle and view them in a separate grid  
- Open a **View Recipe** modal with a full‑size image, detailed description, and step‑by‑step instructions  

**Live Site:** [Vegan Recipe Finder on GitHub Pages](https://carlssonanton87.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

## User Experience

**Vegan Recipe Finder** exists to simplify meal planning for anyone cooking plant‑based at home. Too often, home cooks end up with forgotten veggies and pantry staples—then waste time hunting through multiple websites for a recipe that matches what they already have. This app lets users:

- **Enter exactly what’s in their kitchen** and get instant vegan recipe suggestions  
- **Apply dietary filters** (gluten‑free, high‑protein, quick meals) to match personal needs  
- **Save favorite recipes** for easy access later  
- **View full step‑by‑step instructions** and images in a clean, interactive modal  

By reducing recipe hunting to a few clicks, Vegan Recipe Finder helps users save time, reduce food waste, and explore new plant‑based dishes tailored to their own pantry.  


### User Stories

- **First‑time Visitor**  
  “As a first‑time visitor, I want to quickly find vegan recipes using ingredients I already have, so I don’t waste time searching unrelated recipes.”

- **Returning User**  
  “As a returning user, I want to save my favorite recipes so I can easily revisit them later.”

- **Health‑Conscious User**  
  “As someone with dietary restrictions, I want to filter recipes (e.g., gluten‑free, high‑protein) to meet my needs.”

## Design


### Colour Scheme

I selected this five‑tone palette to reflect both freshness and warmth, perfect for a vegan cooking app:

- **#006d77 (Deep Teal):** Anchors the design with a calm, trustworthy tone for headers and primary actions.  
- **#83c5be (Turquoise):** Soft secondary color for buttons and borders, suggesting vitality and clarity.  
- **#edf6f9 (Pale Aqua):** Clean, airy background that keeps the interface light and lets content breathe.  
- **#ffddd2 (Soft Peach):** Gentle section backgrounds (ingredients & filters) that add warmth without overpowering.  
- **#e29578 (Muted Coral):** Accent color for tags and highlights, injecting energy and guiding the eye to key elements.  

Together, these hues balance each other—cool greens and teals set a fresh, health‑focused mood, while the peach and coral bring a friendly, appetizing warmth.```

### Typography

I used **Montserrat** from Google Fonts:
- **Weights:** 400 (regular) & 600 (semi‑bold)  
- **Reason:** Clean, modern, and highly legible on both desktop and mobile.

### Imagery

Recipe images are fetched from the Spoonacular API. They’re cropped and displayed at 160 px height with `object-fit: cover` to maintain a consistent look.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created bu using Visily.ai

## Testing

### Manual Testing Principles
I opted for manual testing in this phase because it let me exercise and validate each interactive flow—adding/removing ingredients, toggling favorites, opening/closing the modal—directly in the browser. Manual checks helped catch UI quirks, accessibility focus issues, and asynchronous timing edge‑cases more quickly than setting up an automated suite. Once the core functionality is solid, I plan to introduce automated unit and integration tests to guard against regressions.

- **Testing Process:** I manually exercised every user flow in Chrome, Firefox and Safari (desktop + mobile emulation), validated HTML/CSS with the W3C validators, checked for console errors in DevTools, and tested keyboard navigation/aria‑label announcements to ensure accessibility.

- **Manual Flows**  
  Verifying interactive behaviors (adding/removing ingredients, favorites, modal open/close) by hand.
- **Edge Cases**  
  Checking empty inputs, slow network behavior, and error displays.

### Test Cases & Results

1. **Search with No Ingredients**  
   - **Steps:** Click **Search Recipes** without adding any tags.  
   - **Expected:** Console logs “No ingredients selected.” No API call made.  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

2. **Add & Remove Ingredient Tags**  
   - **Steps:** Add “tofu”, “spinach”; click the ✕ on “spinach”.  
   - **Expected:** Only “tofu” remains displayed.  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

3. **Fetch & Display Recipes**  
   - **Steps:** Add at least one ingredient and click **Search Recipes**.  
   - **Expected:** 10 recipe cards load with image, title, and shortened summary.  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

4. **Favorite a Recipe & Persistence**  
   - **Steps:** Click ★ on a recipe card, then refresh the page.  
   - **Expected:** That card remains starred and appears in Favorites.  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

5. **Open & Close Modal**  
   - **Steps:** Click **View recipe** on any card; click × or outside the modal.  
   - **Expected:** Modal opens with full details, then closes.  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

6. **Invalid API Response Handling**  
   - **Steps:** Temporarily remove API key and search again.  
   - **Expected:** Error message displays: “Error fetching recipes. Please try again later.”  
   - **Result:** ✅ Pass

## Bug Fixes
### Bug: API Fetch Failing Initially
- **Description:**  
  First fetch attempt failed because our script ran before the DOM was ready and the results container wasn’t defined.  
- **Impact:**  
  No recipes displayed on search, blocking API integration testing.  
- **Resolution:**  
  Wrapped all DOM queries and event listeners inside a `DOMContentLoaded` handler and ensured `resultsContainer` is correctly selected.  
- **Status:**  
  Fixed in commit `feat: Integrate Spoonacular API with real data and wrap code in DOMContentLoaded`.

## Development Process
1. **Initial Setup**  
   Created base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript scaffolding; set up GitHub repo.  
2. **Ingredient Tag & Filter System**  
   Built dynamic ingredient‑tag component and filter checkboxes.  
3. **API Integration**  
   Integrated Spoonacular’s `complexSearch` endpoint with `diet=vegan` and added filter parameters.  
4. **Recipe Card Layout**  
   Designed a responsive CSS Grid of recipe cards, each with an image, title, and truncated summary.  
5. **Favorites Functionality**  
   Added a star toggle to save favorites, displayed in a separate responsive grid.  
6. **Full Recipe Modal**  
   Implemented a modal that fetches and shows full recipe details (image, summary, instructions).  
7. **Summary Shortening**  
   Added helper functions to strip HTML and shorten long summaries for improved readability.
